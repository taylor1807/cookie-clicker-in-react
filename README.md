this weeks project i found good at showing me the differences between vanilla and react.
the use of components was challenging at first, but after sorting the relationships fro the first couple the remaining became easier.
i did find it very beneficial to have my week03 vanilla cookie clicker open during this project, like the use of localSorage was virtually identical except the use of useEffect. soundeffects were a little more challenging especially with the toggleoption in my options button, i had to pass props about to get things working.

i did make use of a lot more console.logs this time to see what was happening (i had an issue with the upgrade sound effect not changing when toggled on or off, using the log i found out i had forgotten to add a prop on the app.jsx).

i have imported some google fonts this time too as i felt the standard fonts didn't fit what i was going for, the buttons are supposed to look a bit 8bit, i do think i may of gone a little overboard with the shadow but i liked the blue bleed effect that merges with the background image.

this time i decided to add into the upgrades the amount purchased and to disable buttons when not enough cookies were available after receiving feedback from friends as i got them to test it out and recommend changes(i love ternary operators makes things so much simpler), i did a lot of googling and the guides online helped considerably.

the code for removing the selection square of the cookie was copied from my week03 project which in turn was found on stackoverflow as the blue square bugged a friend of mine whilst he was testing.

the biggest challenge i found was changing the layout when 800px was reached but the mdn grid and grid area guides helped with that as i had an idea what i wanted in my head but couldn't think of the syntax to do it, but it came out how i wanted in the end.

i have also annotated the code a bit more this time to help keep track of where everything is.

i would like to thank, mdn, stackoverflow, css tricks, dailyDEV, dev.to and the react guide to help me through this, i now believe i have a better understanding of how it works and tbh i think i prefer it to vanilla javascript.
